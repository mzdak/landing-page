# landing-page

This is my first project following The Odin Project.
While a bit challenging, it was a fun little project.

Even though it wasnt required, i tried to keep the website as close to the sample provided as possible.

Being the first project, I'm sure there are a lot of issues with the code and logic used. I intend to get 
back to all of my projects and refactor them eventually.
