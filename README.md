This is my first project following The Odin Project.
While a bit challenging, it was a fun little project.

Even though it wasnt required, i tried to keep the website as close to the sample provided as possible.

My current worries are whether I used best practises. I'm pretty sure my code contains a lot of useless statements
which probably don't do anything.
